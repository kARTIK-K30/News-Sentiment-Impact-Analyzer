## API Key Setup

This project fetches real-time news data using a news API.
For security reasons, the API key is **not included in this repository**.

If you want to run this project locally, you must create your own API key and add it to the project.

### Steps to Get Your API Key

1. Go to the official website: https://newsapi.org
2. Click on **Get API Key**.
3. Sign up using your email account.
4. After verification, you will receive your **API key** in the dashboard.
5. Copy the API key.

### How to Add the API Key to the Project

1. Open the file where the API key is used (for example `news_collector.py`).
2. Replace the placeholder with your API key.

Example:

```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Important Note

The API key is not included in this repository to protect security and prevent misuse.
Every user should generate their own API key from the official News API website.

### Tip

You can also store the API key in an environment variable or `.env` file for better security.

# 🧠 AI News Sentiment Impact Analyzer

An AI-powered dashboard that collects live news, analyzes sentiment, detects possible fake news, identifies topics, and predicts potential market impact.
The dashboard also visualizes stock market data and compares it with overall news sentiment.

This project demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **data visualization** can be combined to extract insights from news data.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The **AI News Sentiment Impact Analyzer** automatically collects the latest news articles using a news API, processes the text, and performs multiple AI-based analyses such as:

* News sentiment detection
* Topic classification
* Fake news probability estimation
* Market sentiment prediction
* Stock price visualization

The results are displayed in an interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to easily explore news insights.

---

# 🚀 Features

### 📰 Live News Collection

Fetches the latest news articles from an external news API.

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis

Determines whether each news article has a **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiment.

### 🧠 Topic Detection

Automatically categorizes news into topics such as:

* Technology
* Business
* Politics
* Finance
* General News

### 🚨 Fake News Probability

Estimates the likelihood that a news article could be misleading or fake.

### 📊 Sentiment Visualization

Displays sentiment distribution using charts to understand overall news tone.

### 📈 Market Sentiment Prediction

Calculates a market sentiment score based on news sentiment to indicate whether the market outlook is:

* Bullish
* Bearish

# ⚙️ How the System Works

The project workflow consists of multiple stages.

## 1️⃣ News Collection

The system retrieves news articles using a news API.

The collected data includes:

* Article title
* Source
* URL
* Description
* Image

This step is handled in:

```
utils/news_collector.py
```

---

## 2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis

Each news article title is analyzed using NLP techniques to determine its sentiment.

Possible outputs:

* Positive
* Negative
* Neutral

This logic is implemented in:

```
models/sentiment_model.py
```

---

## 3️⃣ Topic Detection

The system categorizes articles into topics based on keywords.

Example topics include:

* Technology
* Finance
* Politics
* Business

Implemented in:

```
models/topic_detector.py
```

---

## 4️⃣ Fake News Detection

A probability score is generated indicating the likelihood of fake news.

Currently this is a heuristic-based approach but can be replaced with a machine learning model.

Implemented in:

```
models/fake_news_detector.py
```

---

## 5️⃣ Data Visualization

The processed news data is visualized through an interactive dashboard created using **Streamlit**.

Visual components include:

* News article cards
* Sentiment distribution charts
* Market sentiment indicators
* Stock price graphs

---

# 📊 Market Sentiment Algorithm

Market sentiment is calculated using:

```
Market Score = (Positive News - Negative News) / Total News
```

Interpretation:

| Score Range | Market Prediction |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| > 0.2       | Bullish Market    |
| < -0.2      | Bearish Market    |
| Otherwise   | Stable Market     |
